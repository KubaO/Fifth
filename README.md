Professional Fifth

Cliff Click and I designed and built a complete programming environment for PCs (and later 68000 based embedded systems).  

Fifth is based on Forth.  It works very much like Forth, but provides this really cool if terribly simple character monitor based UI.  Anyway, for a number of years I couldn't put my hands on a copy of the full environment.

You can find the Shareware version on the web if you look.  Yes, you heard that right.  Fifth predates Open Source by a few years.  But try as I might, I could not find a copy of the full version (which exports stand alone executables, and allows you to take snapshots of the environment with your own additions already loaded).

But I did find a copy.  And I release it to the world.  I'd like to say as open source, but I can't because I doubt the source exists any more.  If it does, it is on some really old drives that I haven't looked at yet.  But all the various Fifth programs that were distributed with Fifth are here.  And I welcome the world to add to the Library of Open Sourced Fifth programs!

Fifth runs just fine in DosBox on Linux, and I imagine it works find under DosBox on Windows or a Mac.

Download a copy, and freely distribute as you see fit.
