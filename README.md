Fifth

Professional Fifth

Cliff Click and I designed and built a complete programming environment for PCs 
(and later 68000 based embedded systems).  

Fifth is based on Forth.  It works very much like Forth, but provides this 
really cool if terribly simple character monitor based UI.  Anyway, for a 
number of years I couldn't put my hands on a copy of the full environment.

You can find the Shareware version on the web if you look.  Yes, you heard 
that right.  Fifth predates Open Source by a few years.  But try as I might, 
I could not find a copy of the full version (which exports stand alone 
executables, and allows you to take snapshots of the environment with your 
own additions already loaded).

But I did find a copy.  And I release it to the world.  I'd like to say as 
open source, but I can't because I doubt the source exists any more.  If it 
does, it is on some really old drives that I haven't looked at yet.  But all 
the various Fifth programs that were distributed with Fifth are here.  And 
I welcome the world to add to the Library of Open Sourced Fifth programs!

Fifth runs just fine in DosBox, which provides an old style MS-DOS environment
on nearly all hardware so you can run those old MS-DOS based games!

You can find DosBox here: http://www.dosbox.com/
